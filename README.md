# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Project

This project provides insights into hospital performance and distribution across the United States using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** for preprocessing.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `HospInfo.csv`: The raw hospital data file (source: Kaggle).
- `projecthospital.sql`: SQL script to create the `hosp` table and perform analysis.
- `hospitalanalysis.pbix`: Power BI report file with data visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you’re reading it!).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Microsoft Power BI**
- **Microsoft Excel** – for initial data cleaning
- **Git & GitHub**

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Includes:

- Average hospital rating by state (Bar Chart)
- Hospital count by type and ownership (Pie Charts)
- Distribution of emergency services by ownership
- State-wise hospital availability (Donut Chart)

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries Performed

- Count of hospitals by state
- Average ratings per state
- Filtering hospitals by mortality rating
- Grouping by hospital type and ownership

## 🧼 Data Source & Preparation

- **Source**: Kaggle (Hospital General Information Dataset)
- **Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized columns using **Excel**
- **Upload**: Cleaned data saved as `HospInfo.csv` and imported into SQL

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **SQL Setup**:
   - Run `projecthospital.sql` to create and populate the `hosp` table.
   - Use queries for analysis or connect to Power BI for live querying.

2. **Power BI Setup**:
   - Open `hospitalanalysis.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
   - Refresh data if needed based on your local setup.
